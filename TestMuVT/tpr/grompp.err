NOTE 1 [file /home/rpool/MARTINI/EOS_CG_water/T900.0/muVT/mu0/mdp/hybrid.mdp, line unknown]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.


NOTE 2 [file /home/rpool/MARTINI/EOS_CG_water/T900.0/muVT/mu0/mdp/hybrid.mdp, line unknown]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rcoulomb.


NOTE 3 [file /home/rpool/MARTINI/EOS_CG_water/T900.0/muVT/mu0/mdp/hybrid.mdp, line unknown]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rvdw.
