.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_energy extracts energy components or distance restraint
\&data from an energy file. The user is prompted to interactively
\&select the energy terms she wants.


\&Average and RMSD are calculated with full precision from the
\&simulation (see printed manual). Drift is calculated by performing
\&a LSQ fit of the data to a straight line. Total drift is drift
\&multiplied by total time. The term fluctuation gives the RMSD around
\&the LSQ fit.


\&When the \fB \-viol\fR option is set, the time averaged
\&violations are plotted and the running time\-averaged and
\&instantaneous sum of violations are recalculated. Additionally
\&running time\-averaged and instantaneous distances between
\&selected pairs can be plotted with the \fB \-pairs\fR option.


\&Options \fB \-ora\fR, \fB \-ort\fR, \fB \-oda\fR, \fB \-odr\fR and
\&\fB \-odt\fR are used for analyzing orientation restraint data.
\&The first two options plot the orientation, the last three the
\&deviations of the orientations from the experimental values.
\&The options that end on an 'a' plot the average over time
\&as a function of restraint. The options that end on a 't'
\&prompt the user for restraint label numbers and plot the data
\&as a function of time. Option \fB \-odr\fR plots the RMS
\&deviation as a function of restraint.
\&When the run used time or ensemble averaged orientation restraints,
\&option \fB \-orinst\fR can be used to analyse the instantaneous,
\&not ensemble\-averaged orientations and deviations instead of
\&the time and ensemble averages.


\&Option \fB \-oten\fR plots the eigenvalues of the molecular order
\&tensor for each orientation restraint experiment. With option
\&\fB \-ovec\fR also the eigenvectors are plotted.


\&With \fB \-fee\fR an estimate is calculated for the free\-energy
\&difference with an ideal gas state: 

\&  Delta A = A(N,V,T) \- A_idgas(N,V,T) = kT ln  e(Upot/kT) 

\&  Delta G = G(N,p,T) \- G_idgas(N,p,T) = kT ln  e(Upot/kT) 

\&where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is set by \fB \-fetemp\fR andthe average is over the ensemble (or time in a trajectory).
\&Note that this is in principle
\&only correct when averaging over the whole (Boltzmann) ensemble
\&and using the potential energy. This also allows for an entropy
\&estimate using:

\&  Delta S(N,V,T) = S(N,V,T) \- S_idgas(N,V,T) = (Upot \- Delta A)/T

\&  Delta S(N,p,T) = S(N,p,T) \- S_idgas(N,p,T) = (Upot + pV \- Delta G)/T
\&


\&When a second energy file is specified (\fB \-f2\fR), a free energy
\&difference is calculated dF = \-kT ln  e  \-(EB\-EA)/kT A ,
\&where EA and EB are the energies from the first and second energy
\&files, and the average is over the ensemble A. \fB NOTE\fR that
\&the energies must both be calculated from the same trajectory.
