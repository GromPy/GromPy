.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_kinetics reads two xvg files, each one containing data for N replicas.
\&The first file contains the temperature of each replica at each timestep,and the second contains real values that can be interpreted as
\&an indicator for folding. If the value in the file is larger than
\&the cutoff it is taken to be unfolded and the other way around.


\&From these data an estimate of the forward and backward rate constants
\&for folding is made at a reference temperature. In addition,a theoretical melting curve and free energy as a function of temperatureare printed in an xvg file.


\&The user can give a max value to be regarded as intermediate
\&(\fB \-ucut\fR), which, when given will trigger the use of an intermediate state
\&in the algorithm to be defined as those structures that have
\&cutoff  DATA  ucut. Structures with DATA values larger than ucut will
\&not be regarded as potential folders. In this case 8 parameters are optimized.


\&The average fraction foled is printed in an xvg file together with the fit to it.
\&If an intermediate is used a further file will show the build of the intermediate and the fit to that process.


\&The program can also be used with continuous variables (by setting
\&\fB \-nodiscrete\fR). In this case kinetics of other processes can be
\&studied. This is very much a work in progress and hence the manual
\&(this information) is lagging behind somewhat.


\&In order to compile this program you need access to the GNU
\&scientific library.
