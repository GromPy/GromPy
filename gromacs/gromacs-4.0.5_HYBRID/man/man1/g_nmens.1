.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_nmens\fR generates an ensemble around an average structure
\&in a subspace which is defined by a set of normal modes (eigenvectors).
\&The eigenvectors are assumed to be mass\-weighted.
\&The position along each eigenvector is randomly taken from a Gaussian
\&distribution with variance kT/eigenvalue.


\&By default the starting eigenvector is set to 7, since the first six
\&normal modes are the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.
