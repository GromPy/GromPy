Once installed, this directory contains a Makefile and 
a small program that you could use as a template when 
writing your own analysis software.

A Makefile.arch is created for each architecture you install 
with the correct paths and libraries. You will have to link
(or copy) the correct makefile to "Makefile" or use the -f 
option to gmake in order to select a makefile.

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory, 
there will be a Makefile.am which automake uses to 
create a Makefile.in which in turn is converted to
a Makefile by the configure script. Note that this is
NOT the template makefile - it is called Template.mak,
and used to create Makefile.arch at build time.

You should NOT touch or copy Makefile.in unless you
really know what you are doing - it is a template file
used by the configure script to create the real Makefile.

If you want to use automake and autoconf yourself, look
in the contrib directory of the distribution.
