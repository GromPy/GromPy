.SH DESCRIPTION
\&This program reads a pdb file, reads
\&some database files, adds hydrogens to the molecules and generates
\&coordinates in Gromacs (Gromos) format and a topology in Gromacs format.
\&These files can subsequently be processed to generate a run input file.
\&


\&The force fields in the distribution are currently:


\&oplsaa OPLS\-AA/L all\-atom force field (2001 aminoacid dihedrals)

\&G43b1  GROMOS96 43b1 Vacuum Forcefield 

\&G43a1  GROMOS96 43a1 Forcefield 

\&G43a2  GROMOS96 43a2 Forcefield (improved alkane dihedrals)

\&G45a3  GROMOS96 45a3 Forcefield 

\&G53a5  GROMOS96 53a5 Forcefield 

\&G53a6  GROMOS96 53a6 Forcefield 

\&gmx    Gromacs Forcefield (a modified GROMOS87, see manual)

\&encads Encad all\-atom force field, using scaled\-down vacuum charges

\&encadv Encad all\-atom force field, using full solvent charges


\&The corresponding data files can be found in the library directory
\&with names like ffXXXX.YYY. Check chapter 5 of the manual for more
\&information about file formats. By default the forcefield selection
\&is interactive, but you can use the \fB \-ff\fR option to specify
\&one of the short names above on the command line instead. In that
\&case pdb2gmx just looks for the corresponding file.


\&Note that a pdb file is nothing more than a file format, and it
\&need not necessarily contain a protein structure. Every kind of
\&molecule for which there is support in the database can be converted.
\&If there is no support in the database, you can add it yourself.


\&The program has limited intelligence, it reads a number of database
\&files, that allow it to make special bonds (Cys\-Cys, Heme\-His, etc.),
\&if necessary this can be done manually. The program can prompt the
\&user to select which kind of LYS, ASP, GLU, CYS or HIS residue she
\&wants. For LYS the choice is between LYS (two protons on NZ) or LYSH
\&(three protons, default), for ASP and GLU unprotonated (default) or
\&protonated, for HIS the proton can be either on ND1 (HISA), on NE2
\&(HISB) or on both (HISH). By default these selections are done
\&automatically. For His, this is based on an optimal hydrogen bonding
\&conformation. Hydrogen bonds are defined based on a simple geometric
\&criterium, specified by the maximum hydrogen\-donor\-acceptor angle
\&and donor\-acceptor distance, which are set by \fB \-angle\fR and
\&\fB \-dist\fR respectively.


\&Option \fB \-merge\fR will ask if you want to merge consecutive chains
\&into one molecule definition, this can be useful for connecting chains
\&with a disulfide brigde or intermolecular distance restraints.


\&pdb2gmx will also check the occupancy field of the pdb file.
\&If any of the occupanccies are not one, indicating that the atom is
\&not resolved well in the structure, a warning message is issued.
\&When a pdb file does not originate from an X\-Ray structure determination
\&all occupancy fields may be zero. Either way, it is up to the user
\&to verify the correctness of the input data (read the article!).


\&During processing the atoms will be reordered according to Gromacs
\&conventions. With \fB \-n\fR an index file can be generated that
\&contains one group reordered in the same way. This allows you to
\&convert a Gromos trajectory and coordinate file to Gromos. There is
\&one limitation: reordering is done after the hydrogens are stripped
\&from the input and before new hydrogens are added. This means that
\&you should not use \fB \-ignh\fR.


\&The \fB .gro\fR and \fB .g96\fR file formats do not support chain
\&identifiers. Therefore it is useful to enter a pdb file name at
\&the \fB \-o\fR option when you want to convert a multichain pdb file.
\&


\&The option \fB \-vsite\fR removes hydrogen and fast improper dihedral
\&motions. Angular and out\-of\-plane motions can be removed by changing
\&hydrogens into virtual sites and fixing angles, which fixes their
\&position relative to neighboring atoms. Additionally, all atoms in the
\&aromatic rings of the standard amino acids (i.e. PHE, TRP, TYR and HIS)
\&can be converted into virtual sites, elminating the fast improper dihedral
\&fluctuations in these rings. Note that in this case all other hydrogen
\&atoms are also converted to virtual sites. The mass of all atoms that are
\&converted into virtual sites, is added to the heavy atoms.


\&Also slowing down of dihedral motion can be done with \fB \-heavyh\fR
\&done by increasing the hydrogen\-mass by a factor of 4. This is also
\&done for water hydrogens to slow down the rotational motion of water.
\&The increase in mass of the hydrogens is subtracted from the bonded
\&(heavy) atom so that the total mass of the system remains the same.
