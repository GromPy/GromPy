.SH DESCRIPTION
\&This is an analysis program that implements the Weighted
\&Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM).  It is intended to analyze
\&.pdo files generated by mdrun using umbrella sampling tocreate a potential of mean force (PMF). The options are

\&  \fB \-o\fR      name of the PMF output file

\&  \fB \-hist\fR   name of the histograms output file

\&  \fB \-min\fR    minimum coordinate to use

\&  \fB \-max\fR    maximum coordinate to use


\&Note: the program will throw out any data that is outside
\&of min \- max. The program will output the true min and max
\&after completion, so you can use these values the next time.
\&or you can use:

\&  \fB \-noprof\fR only calculate min and max

\&  \fB \-bins\fR   number of bins to use in calculation
