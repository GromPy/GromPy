.SH DESCRIPTION
\&tpbconv can edit run input files in four ways.

\fB 1st.\fR by modifying the number of steps in a run input file
\&with option \fB \-nsteps\fR or option \fB \-runtime\fR.


\&\fB 2st.\fR (OBSOLETE) by creating a run input file
\&for a continuation run when your simulation has crashed due to e.g.
\&a full disk, or by making a continuation run input file.
\&This option is obsolete, since mdrun now writes and reads
\&checkpoint files.
\&Note that a frame with coordinates and velocities is needed.
\&When pressure and/or Nose\-Hoover temperature coupling is used
\&an energy file can be supplied to get an exact continuation
\&of the original run.


\&\fB 3nd.\fR by creating a tpx file for a subset of your original
\&tpx file, which is useful when you want to remove the solvent from
\&your tpx file, or when you want to make e.g. a pure Ca tpx file.
\&\fB WARNING: this tpx file is not fully functional\fR.
\&\fB 4rd.\fR by setting the charges of a specified group
\&to zero. This is useful when doing free energy estimates
\&using the LIE (Linear Interaction Energy) method.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "\-[no]h"  "no    "
 Print help info and quit

.BI "\-nice"  " int" " 0" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "\-nsteps"  " int" " \-1" 
 Change the number of steps

.BI "\-runtime"  " real" " \-1    " 
 Set the run time (ps)

.BI "\-time"  " real" " \-1    " 
 Continue from frame at this time (ps) instead of the last frame

.BI "\-extend"  " real" " 0     " 
 Extend runtime by this amount (ps)
