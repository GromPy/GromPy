.SH DESCRIPTION
\&g_mindist computes the distance between one group and a number of
\&other groups. Both the minimum distance
\&(between any pair of atoms from the respective groups)
\&and the number of contacts within a given
\&distance are written to two separate output files.
\&With \fB \-or\fR, minimum distances to each residue in the first
\&group are determined and plotted as a function of reisdue number.


\&With option \fB \-pi\fR the minimum distance of a group to its
\&periodic image is plotted. This is useful for checking if a protein
\&has seen its periodic image during a simulation. Only one shift in
\&each direction is considered, giving a total of 26 shifts.
\&It also plots the maximum distance within the group and the lengths
\&of the three box vectors.


\&Other programs that calculate distances are \fB g_dist\fR
\&and \fB g_bond\fR.
