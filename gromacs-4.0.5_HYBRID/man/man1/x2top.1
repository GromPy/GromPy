.SH DESCRIPTION
\&x2top generates a primitive topology from a coordinate file.
\&The program assumes all hydrogens are present when defining
\&the hybridization from the atom name and the number of bonds.
\&The program can also make an rtp entry, which you can then add
\&to the rtp database.


\&When \fB \-param\fR is set, equilibrium distances and angles
\&and force constants will be printed in the topology for all
\&interactions. The equilibrium distances and angles are taken
\&from the input coordinates, the force constant are set with
\&command line options.The force fields supported currently are:


\&G43a1  GROMOS96 43a1 Forcefield (official distribution)


\&oplsaa OPLS\-AA/L all\-atom force field (2001 aminoacid dihedrals)


\&G43b1  GROMOS96 43b1 Vacuum Forcefield (official distribution)


\&gmx    Gromacs Forcefield (a modified GROMOS87, see manual)


\&G43a2  GROMOS96 43a2 Forcefield (development) (improved alkane dihedrals)


\&The corresponding data files can be found in the library directory
\&with names like ffXXXX.YYY. Check chapter 5 of the manual for more
\&information about file formats. By default the forcefield selection
\&is interactive, but you can use the \fB \-ff\fR option to specify
\&one of the short names above on the command line instead. In that
\&case pdb2gmx just looks for the corresponding file.

.SH KNOWN PROBLEMS
\- The atom type selection is primitive. Virtually no chemical knowledge is used

\- Periodic boundary conditions screw up the bonding

\- No improper dihedrals are generated

\- The atoms to atomtype translation table is incomplete (ffG43a1.n2t file in the $GMXLIB directory). Please extend it and send the results back to the GROMACS crew.
